# OS
Hello there ^^\
This is a little thing I'm working on and just thought:

### "Why not?"
of course, building an OS from scratch is difficult but-\
It's a project that I'll learn as I'll go,
just for funs and learning.\
yee .w.

# This project uses NASM, QEMU, and ZIG
### [**NASM**](https://nasm.us/)
is a free open source assembly compiler that makes this and many other sorts of projects possible..\
\
the documentation isn't easy to read through though...

### [**Qemu**](https://www.qemu.org/)
is a free open source emulator that can work with .bin files...\
unlike virtual box...

### [**Zig**](https://ziglang.org/)
Zig is an in-development low-level programming language.\
That is honestly much easier to read than most other low-level programmming languages.\
\
It doesn't have a preprocessor, nor macros, what it does have the ability for is *metaprogramming~* and *testing* right out of the box!
